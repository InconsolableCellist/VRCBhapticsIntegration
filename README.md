# VRCBhapticsIntegration
Mod for VRChat using MelonLoader  
Special Thanks to [bHaptics](https://www.bhaptics.com) for making the bHaptics Gear as well as supporting me and this mod wherever needed! :D

- Allows you to use your bHaptics Gear to feel touch in VRChat when using bHaptics Compatible Avatars.
- Includes a Unity Package for you to use in the Unity Editor to create your own custom bHaptics Compatible Avatars.
- Supports all bHaptics Devices.

### KNOWN ISSUES:

- On some hardware changing into a bHaptics Compatible Avatar will induce a crash with or without the Mod.  
To help with this use your own custom Avatar and make sure you don't turn on too many devices in the Mod Settings.

- Tracking Object Occlusion may not work properly on the Oculus Platform.  
This means that the holographic display of your controllers may cause haptics to trigger.  
If this is too much of an issue for you switch over to using the Steam Platform where Tracking Object Occlusion is working properly.
